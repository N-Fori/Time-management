What is the Pomodoro Technique?
A time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

1 Pomodoro = 25 minutes work + 5 minutes break

After 4 Pomodoros, take a 20-minute long break
